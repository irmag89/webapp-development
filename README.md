# Web Application Development
This repository holds a collection of concepts for developing web applications.

Each concept definition is contained into a folder. In order to fully explain the concept, the folder may have sub-folders (parts of an example) that implement frontend and backend examples. The examples are not meant to be complete nor to provide a rich user experience.

There is also a final project folder which aims at the integration of multiple concepts into a single web application.
